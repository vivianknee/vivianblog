# Individual Seed Blog

## AP Exam Preparation
I asked chat to write up a potential plan to study for the AP exam starting now till the day of my exam. I think it did a pretty good job. I will likely tweak some things and go off this plan a little but its a good foundation.:

- Solve coding problems related to these concepts.
- Start exploring basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Week 4-5 (March 29 - April 11): Advanced Java Concepts
- Dive into more complex Java topics like recursion, file I/O, and exception handling.
- Practice solving coding problems that involve these concepts.

Week 6 (April 12 - April 18): Data Structures and Algorithms
- Study basic data structures like ArrayLists and LinkedLists.
- Understand sorting and searching algorithms.
- Solve coding problems related to data structures and algorithms.

Week 7 (April 19 - April 25): Practice Exams and Debugging
- Take full-length practice exams to simulate exam conditions.
