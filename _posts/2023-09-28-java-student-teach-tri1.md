## List of tech terms required
> A big emphasis on learning Units #1-#10 is learning vocabulary.  ***Be sure to incorporate all of these terms into your units as applicable.***  Don't just have a list of definitions.  It is best if vocabulary is incorporated within working code, ie Jupyter Notebooks.
