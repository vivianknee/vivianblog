# Tri 2 Mini Project 

## Purpose
This project was the sorting project we did over the course of 3 weeks. This project utilizes sorting and Fibonacci to create an art gallery that can be sorted by popularity. Users visiting the site can interact with the art pieces, choose their favorite, and like it. They can then sort the arts by likes and see a visualization of the sort, the number of steps it takes to sort, and the total time in NS. The Fibonacci portion of the project allows the user to input a number (nth term) and a piece of art is created based on it.

## Assets
- sorting art gallery
- animation of sorting
- fibonacci art generator with fibonacci sorts

**Something you are passionate about in the upcoming project**
- I am excited to make the frontend look extra professional. For my past few projects, I've focused mainly on the backend and have been able to really familiarize myself with Springboot, deployment, and using JAVA to write APIS, etc so for this project, I hope to focus more on the frontend aspect and possibly build upon the animation I did in my previous project.
