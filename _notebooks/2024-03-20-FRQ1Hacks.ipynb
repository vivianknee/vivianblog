    "\n",
    "(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.\n",
    "- primitive types are the simplest types that are usually built into the programming language. Examples include integer, float, and boolean. Primitive types are usually stored directly in memory\n",
    "- reference types hold references to other data in memory. reference types store the memory address where the data is stored whereas primitive types store the actual value. Examples include arrays, objects, classes.\n",

    "(b) Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.\n",
    "- Primitive types store the actual value of the data in memory where as reference types hold references to data in the memory. \n",
    "- Primitive types have less memory usage since they only store the actual value. reference types have more memory usage since they store the actual data and the reference to the data\n",
