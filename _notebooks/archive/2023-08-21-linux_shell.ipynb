This kernel provides a shell, or <mark>terminal</mark>, that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands.  Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell/terminal as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process.  To activate a shell directly, users will run a \"terminal\" through the Desktop. <mark>VS Code provides ability to activate \"terminal\"</mark> while in the IDE."
