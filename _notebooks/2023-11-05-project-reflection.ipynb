    "Overall I worked on the frontend logic of the Dijkstra algorithm, building and interface using JointJS for the UI, Tailwind and DaisyUI for styling, and fetch for retrieving data from the backend. I usually commit all at once rather than in sections, making sure that the current section of code I am working on is functioning correctly before deploying it on the main site.\n",

    "\n",
    "I coded the frontend logic for creating the UI using the JointJS library, along with Lodash, Backbone, and JQuery. The three prior libraries are used in JointJS to create an advanced HTML canvas that allows for shapes to be manipulated in numerous ways for any purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began with a Svelte based website, which gave trouble with reloading, where when the page was loaded, the JointJS canvas would stay for a millisecond and disappear. We then decided that this wouldn't work so we decided to transition to a VueJS based site, which also didn't work because it wouldn't import the dependencies for JointJS correctly. In the end we just decided to use a Jekyll frame work that I created over the summer, using Jekyll's modular design to design HTML pages and build the site. This is what the framework looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![contributions](/assets/img/post_images/framework.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we still used the `_includes` and `_layouts` in Jekyll but we then use Node.js and the `page` folder to import things like Tailwind and DaisyUI to style our site with custom fonts and classes.\n",

This is something that aided in making the program look and feel smoother, as well as making the entire program more completed at the end. Our collaboration as a team was definitely very good and I think that it could be even better with people learning how to manage the Scrum Board and also how to read it (with all of it's tags and other features). In the future I want to work on making cleaner and more sophisticated designs, with more integrated pages and features."
